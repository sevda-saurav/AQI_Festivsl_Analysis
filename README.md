# AQI_Festivsl_Analysis Power BI Project

Overview

This Power BI project visualizes the impact of festivals on air pollution levels across major cities in Madhya Pradesh, India. The dashboard offers insights into how festivals such as Diwali, Holi, and New Year influence the Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant levels.

## Objective

To analyze the variation in AQI before, during, and after festivals and identify the contribution of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 during these times.

## Key Features

City-wise comparison of AQI during major festivals

Festival vs. Non-Festival day AQI analysis

Year-wise trend analysis of AQI around festivals

Pollutant contribution distribution by festival

Interactive map visual showing city-wise pollution impact

Tools & Technologies

Power BI for dashboard and data visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures

Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and transformation

Data Sources

Raw AQI data (city-wise and time-stamped)
